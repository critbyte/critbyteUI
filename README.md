# critbyteUI

critbtyeUI is a stylesheet that dramatically changes the look and feel of atom!
Most of the changes will be seen by full stack web developers so most of the syntax 
changes have to do with HTML, CSS, MySQL, PHP and Jquery/Javascript.

critbyteUI helps reduce eyestrain if you are one to stay up late without the lights
on, coding in a dungeon... However it makes it easier to visually see the code
on the screen with the high contrast black with really saturated hues.

critbytUI mimics the feel of most cmd lines and terminals. When alt-tabing or windowing
over to and frow from cmd to atom, do it with less of a sudden flash!

critbyteUI is ment to be used with code minimap, which is a plugin for atom that 
adds a more informative scroll bar. If you choose to not use minimap, just go to
file>stylesheet>styles.less and change the scrollbar width at the bottom on the file.

critbyteUI is completely free!
